# CRW-Archive

a public archive and archive scripts of https://consumerrights.wiki

Below will have the userscript needed to archive and zip the pdf files created the archive takes about ~= 20 minutes and 12-13 gigs of ram to store the files before the download is initiated

Likely i will need to use some cloud service to provide the dump due to file limitations on github and that will be added on later once i get it setup
