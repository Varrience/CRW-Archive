# CRW-Archive

A public archive and archive scripts of https://consumerrights.wiki

Below will have the userscript needed to archive and zip the pdf files created if you decide to do so yourself the archive takes about ~= 20 minutes and 12-13 gigs of ram to store the files before the download is initiated to make sure that the wiki does not have excessive requests to it

## **Note** 
there are two known documents which are big charts of the video directory and some other table archive that have low possibility of being archived for whatever reason these are not consumer rights articles so i have exluded them for the sake of my sanity since most people are here for offline usable articles all text should be readable for the most part tables and other images however may not be in the best condition (i couldn't figure out how to stop article clipping yet unfortunately :-/)

## **Archive Directory**
Likely i will need to use some cloud service to provide the dump due to file limitations on github and that will be added on later once i get it setup

You can access the latest archives i have done via [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ljJzbmXM7quRBWoJo5aPaxcpiZ3MXUyg?usp=drive_link)
Ideally maybe i can get the wiki admins to host the archive somewhere on their server though im not sure how likely that is but this solution will work for now

You are free to use the code as you wish and would appreciate any improvements to the code i wrote

Signing off **Varrience**
