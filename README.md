# CRW-Archive

A public archive and archive scripts of https://consumerrights.wiki

Below will have the userscript needed to archive and zip the pdf files created if you decide to do so yourself the archive takes about ~= 20 minutes and 12-13 gigs of ram to store the files before the download is initiated to make sure that the wiki does not have excessive requests to it

## **Update Note**
this has been resolved in part by either using the full page width or using specific b4 paper margins specifically to stop the majority of clipping or weird formatting between certian images or tables, i have made the executive decision to default the archive option to be for web view since it causes the least amount of conflict from my testing of the few archives which i have performed over the course of a few weeks

## **Archive Directory**
the latest archive date has the best web view format but will likely not be the best for printing due to it being set to fit on one singular page to avoid all page breaks if the need arises to have printable versions of the entire wiki i am availible on their CRW discord so feel free to reach out if you wish for me to grab a updated printable version that is better than the older test archives that i have done previously

You can access the latest archives i have done via [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ljJzbmXM7quRBWoJo5aPaxcpiZ3MXUyg?usp=drive_link)
Ideally maybe i can get the wiki admins to host the archive somewhere on their server though im not sure how likely that is but this solution will work for now
i have optimized the size mainly for text leaving the full size of the archive to be around ~=350mb give or take which still is pretty amazing for a wiki of this size!

You are free to use the code as you wish and would appreciate any improvements to the code i wrote
